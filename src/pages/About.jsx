    <p>
  This project is a demo React application built while practicing core React concepts such as routing, lazy loading, 
  component-based architecture, and Bootstrap integration. It was created by <strong>Vishal Tomar</strong> as 
  part of a hands-on learning exercise. The app demonstrates the use of React Router for page navigation, lazy loading 
  for performance optimization, and React Bootstrap for responsive UI styling. This structured approach helps reinforce best practices 
  in modern React development.
